       <p> My favorite kind of dog is a corgi. I plan to buy one when I grow older,they're super cute. I don't know much about dogs or even corgis, but I hope to learn when I get a dog... soon.</p>

       <p> I also really love toy poodles and plan to buy one when I grow older... with my corgi. They're so cute! </p>
