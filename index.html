  <h2> My Future Dogs </h2>
    <p> My favorite kinds of dog are toy poodles and corgis. I plan to buy one of each when I grow older, they're super cute. I don't know much about dogs, but I hope to learn... soon.</p>

    <p> I really love Thai Food. I realized that I really love it a few years ago when my sister first brought it home.</p>
